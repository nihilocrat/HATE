A simple demo game written in Lua for LOVE2D.

This was originally created to help game designers learn Lua. There was no official tutorial or training available to designers beyond a few links to general Lua tutorials online, which the designers felt was lacking. Using a game to teach them this was a natural choice, and allowed me to introduce more advanced concepts. It is well-commented and targeted at someone who understands very simple programming concepts (variables, if/else, loops, etc.) but not necessarily someone who knows Lua or knows a thing about game programming.
